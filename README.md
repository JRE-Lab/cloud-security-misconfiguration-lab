# Cloud Security Misconfiguration Lab

This lab teaches how to identify and remediate misconfigurations in a cloud environment. It uses open-source scanning tools to audit your cloud accounts for insecure settings and overly permissive access.

## Overview

You will:

- **Define the environment**: Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP) and create a test account or use an existing one with limited permissions.
- **Install scanning tools**: Deploy tools like ScoutSuite or Prowler to audit configurations such as IAM policies, storage bucket permissions, network rules and logging.
- **Run scans**: Execute the scanners against your environment to identify misconfigurations, high-risk services and compliance issues.
- **Interpret findings**: Review the reports to prioritise issues based on severity and impact. Document insecure configurations and potential attack paths.
- **Remediate and re‑scan**: Apply recommended fixes (least privilege policies, encryption, MFA) and run the scans again to ensure issues are resolved.

All data in this lab is collected from your own cloud account using publicly available tools; no proprietary data is required.
